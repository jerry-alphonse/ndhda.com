The JAM stack is rather new to me despite having years of experience using Jekyll and Hexo. In fact, I had been following the [best practices <sub>[1]</sub>](https://jamstack.org/best-practices/){: target="_blank" } or close to them for the better part of a year. 


## What is JAM?

JAM is a

As you might have guessed, JAM is an acroynm standing for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. This means sites built in Drupal or Ruby on Rails aren't JAM.

The benefits are outstanding! Top level performance, highly secure, cheap, scaleble, and most importantly, a much better developer experience. 

## My JAM Journey

Flashback to the start of this year. I took two bulky, poorly designed WordPress informational websites and converted them into Jekyll. These sites hadn't had content updates since the previous decade and I really didn't want to have that many moving parts for something this simple. The aestetics were no longer consistent with the brand so this gave me an opportunity to simplify, optimize, and polish for a higher teir user experience.

I started by building a sandbox site with a kitchen sick of components I knew I was going to use in the redesign. I published the theme gem and spun up two more sites. Dumped the WordPress exports in and voil√†! Two beautiful sites! Well, at least once I got all the image references straightened out.

After that another WordPress site I run started having issues with PayPal, and then WooCommerce, and then SMTP, and issues kept getting racked up almost faster than I could clear them. The decision was made to utilize the Shopify platform.
