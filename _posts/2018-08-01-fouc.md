Many sites suffer from a flash of unstyled content otherwise known as FOUC. This occurs when the page's content is displayed prior to the styles being applied to it or when JavaScript alters the content after loading. 

Let's take a look at [Brad Baxter](http://goo.gl/PVsR7)'s fix for FOUC.

``` javascript
<style type="text/css">
    .js #fouc { display: none; }
</style>
<script type="text/javascript">
    document.documentElement.className = 'js';
</script>
```

The class `.js` is applied through JavaScript as to not affect users who have it disabled. When it is applied it qualifies the selector so that the element is not displayed. 

``` html
<body>
<div id="fouc">
... content to remain hidden until the end ...
</div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        document.getElementById("fouc").style.display="block";
    </script>
</body>
```

The script when placed at the end of the body will show the hidden content, removing the FOUC.
