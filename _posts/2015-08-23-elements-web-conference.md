Worked as a team to develop a web application for the yearly web conference hosted by <a href="https://www.elements.psu.edu/" target="_blank">PSU</a>. The site was built using <a href="https://www.drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal 7</a>, the <a href="http://usecod.com/" target="_blank">Conference Organizing Distribution (COD)</a> module, and <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">Zurb Foundation 5</a>. As a full stack developer I contributed from custom module development to writing SASS for theming.
