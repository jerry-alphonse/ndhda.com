Today we launched an online store, [Meorator!](https://shop.meorator.com/){: target="_blank" }, using the Shopify platform.

The goal of the site is twofold. One, we give artists, entrepreneurs, musicians, and open source projects an easy solution to sell merch to get up and rolling. And two, because we choose projects, bands, etc..., that we're passionate about we go well out of our way to help promote them. 

We treat the organizations we partner with like they're part of our family and are always seeking to grow our network. If you're interested, please fill out the form at the bottom of the page and tells us what you're thinking!
