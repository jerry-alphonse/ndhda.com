Managed and build features in <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> (PHP). Added features such as a notification bar, custom URL shortener, and responsive email templates. Repaired and implemented new security standards after the site was hacked (prior to my arrival). Implemented caching features and currently integrating with a Content Delivery Network to further optimize the site.

Improved SEO dramatically, improving the site's [Alexa Rank](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/solarinnovations.com#trafficstats){:target="_blank"} from almost 2 million in the world to a top 150k in the United States. Created a portal for dealers of our products that let's them sign up for our mailing list, access special documentation, and create a public profile detailing our relationship. Employed social engineering strategies to make web pages trend accross social networks.
