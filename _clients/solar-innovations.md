Solar Innovations produces greenhouses, conservatories, doors, windows, and skylights for residential and commercial applciations. 

I've maintained their website while building out new features and enhancements on it. 

A portal was created so they may better communicate with the dealers of their product lines. A gallery of their projects was also built using Vue.js. 

A network of informational websites was created to educate the public on some of their major product lines. 

In order to best manage the variety of sites managed for Solar a Jekyll gem theme was created. New UI/UX features developed for one site can be ported to the others relatively easily.
