Throughout the time working with Penn State University, many projects over varying scope were completed. 

During my tenure we had to struggle with one of the biggests lapses of funding; The PA State government was sequestered and one of the first things cut was higher education funding. This left us with a tight budget but demands of 'doing more with less.'

It was here that the holistic development approach began to take shape, powered by that need to be as effective as possible with little to no resources available. 

Fortunately we were able to do quite a lot. New features were added to their existing website and many new internal (and some external) systems created.

I consulted with several professors within the Learning Design and Technology department, giving the head of it a kickstart in learning NodeJS. He proceeded to teach it to his graduate students.
