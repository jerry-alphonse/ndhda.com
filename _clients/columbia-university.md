At Columbia University I worked as a Senior Applications Developer focusing on Single Page Applications with RESTful backends, typically using Druapl 8.

I contributed to several existing and new projects, where we pushed the boundries of innovation and design.

Just about every week I would go to Google's NYC Headquarters for developer talks, site reliability, and various other tech meetups. This kept me fresh and up-to-date with the latest advancements in the industry.

Unfortunately my time there ended when I was hit by a truck and broke both arms and wrists. I respectfully resigned and moved home until I recovered.
