The work I've done for IRT Reels is largely unnoticed. Of course you can see the [website redesign](/blog/2018/07/16/irtreels-redesign.html), but much like the tip of an iceberg, that is only a small portion of how quickly they were modernized.

We established a comprehensive backend with Shopify. Depolyed Slack to the staff and tied it into the website's chat feature. Organized a way for customers to submit pictures of their catches through social media for display on the website. Setup the accounts with a version of Quickbooks that was tied into shopify. All of this was organized and automated with Github and Wrike.
